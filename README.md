# OpenThrone - NextJS Project
#### Forked from NextJs-Boilerplate by CreativeDesignsGuru


## Background
OpenThrone is a community project hoping to recreate the TextBased MMORPG called DarkThrone which has gone dark after almost 20years of service. While we are not affiliated with the original DarkThrone project, our community hopes to be able to deliver a game that can pick up where DT left off and bring forth many of the enhancements and hopes that we were patiently waiting for.

## Development Notes
OpenThrone started out as a fork of the Dark Curse project which was originally started by Moppler (Matt Gibney) here: https://github.com/MattGibney/DarkCurse. This project has been archived and is no longer being updated. We've since decided to port it to NextJS/React, while trying to keep a lot of the heavy lift that was already done previously from a design perspective. 

## Game Status - PRE-ALPHA / LIVE DEVELOPMENT
There's currently a live server running at [OpenThrone.Dev](https://openthrone.dev), however it should be noted that at this time, this server is a live development server and will be reset often and sometimes without notice.

## FAQ
- Is the game still being actively developed?

Yes, a small group of volunteers have been working to get a working version of the game up and running.
- What can I do to help?

If you have experience with art, NextJS, or Figma please send a message to DasTacoMann.
- Is it helpful for me to tell you all my ideas for the game?

Currently we are hyper focused on getting the basic mechanics of the game functioning so there will be a time later where ideas can be talked about.

## Other Information
### VSCode information (optional)

If you are VSCode users, you can have a better integration with VSCode by installing the suggested extension in `.vscode/extension.json`. The starter code comes up with Settings for a seamless integration with VSCode. The Debug configuration is also provided for frontend and backend debugging experience.

With the plugins installed on your VSCode, ESLint and Prettier can automatically fix the code and show you the errors. Same goes for testing, you can install VSCode Jest extension to automatically run your tests and it also show the code coverage in context.

Pro tips: if you need a project wide type checking with TypeScript, you can run a build with <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd> on Mac.
